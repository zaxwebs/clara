# ðŸ’  Clara
An MVC framework built with PHP 7.

## Installation
Install a local copy with the instructions below.

### Install LAMP stack
It is assumed you already know how to install a LAMP stack. I recommend doing so with Laragon as it greatly simplifies the task.
Laragon is a portable, isolated, fast & powerful universal development environment for PHP (with MySQL).
You can download it here: https://laragon.org/download/

### Install Composer
Installation instructions: https://getcomposer.org/download/

### Setup Server
1. Create a dedicated directory (and configure) for hosting Clara files. 
2. Clone or copy Clara files to the directory.

## Usage
* Clara is mostly self-documenting.
* Config files are in ```src/setup/```.
* Core files are at ```src/core/```.
* Add controller and models in ```src/app/controllers``` and ```src/app/models``` respectively.

## Project Structure
Clara is built on the following structural architecture:
```bash
/clara
  /public                                   # Assets like images, CSS and JS files here
  /src                                      # Clara source code
    /app                                    # Dedicated directory for controllers and models
      /controllers                          # Add your controllers here
      /models                               # Add your models here
    /core                                   # Clara core classes
    /setup                                  # Dedicated directory for configuration
      config.php                            # Configure globals here
      routes.php                            # Configre routes here
  /vendor                                   # Composer files and 3rd party packages
  .htaccess                                 # Routes all traffic to index.php
  index.php                                 # Initializes app cycle
```
